# Memerable_Places-First_Proper_Android_App
This is my first proper android app that actually provides a function. Ignoring the horrible gradients (they seemed like a cool idea) the app consists of 2 main activities, the first being able to see all stored locations and the second a map activity. The application allows you to long press on a location and save it to the system preferences which are then displayed in the array list using a name generated from GeoEncoder. The code is quite messy as I tried to use multiple classes and fully embrace object oriented programming. If you do want to use the code for yourself go into the google_maps_api.xml file and follow the instructions to generate a google maps api key. THe project worked with multiple activities and permanent data storage which was quite fun and I will certainly be creating much more interesting projects in the near future.
